Don\u2019t worry about spraying the bill or brim of the hat. Depending on what the hat is made of, spritzing water on those areas could do more harm than good. For example, if the inside of the hat's brim is made of cardboard, the water might end up damaging the hat altogether. This method works best with baseball caps, straw hats, and cloth hats (like cotton and felt hats).",
