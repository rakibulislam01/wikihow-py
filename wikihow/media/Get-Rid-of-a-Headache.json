                "description": "Know your type of headache. There are many different types of headaches, and finding out which kind you're suffering from can help you find out the best way to treat your headache. Think about the severity and duration of your headaches as well as where you feel the pain to find out what kind you have. Some common types of headaches include: Tension headaches: These are characterized by mild to moderate pain throughout the head, typically in the forehead or back of the head. Tension headaches typically last for several hours. Sinus headaches: These bring pain that stems in the face at the bridge of the nose or cheeks. They often come with nasal congestion. Sinus headaches generally last for hours and are often seasonal. Migraines: Migraines involve moderate to severe pain and are often accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to light and sound. The pain may be centered in the temples, eyes, or the back of the head. They often last a day or longer. Cluster headaches: This type involves sharp pain around one eye or one side of your head. Bouts of frequent cluster headaches can last weeks or months.",

Earlier treatment is always better to address a headache. Even if you're already in the depths of misery, a quick dose of ibuprofen, acetaminophen, naproxen, aspirin or even a capsaicin nasal spray can take the edge off. Be careful not to take medications unless you\u2019re told to by your doctor. Never take more medication, or take medication more often, than directed by the label. Everyday use of OTC medications can be linked to Medication Overuse Syndrome, where a person takes medication they don\u2019t actually need because they\u2019re afraid of future headaches. This misuse can actually cause frequent, recurrent headaches called \u201crebound headaches. If you frequently take headache medication 3+ times a week, see a doctor.",

Though caffeine (which is included in some OTC pain relievers) can initially help a headache, it can also lead to more headaches over time by developing or worsening a caffeine dependence. During headache attacks, adenosine is elevated in the bloodstream. Caffeine helps by blocking adenosine receptors. If you have frequent headaches, it\u2019s best to avoid all caffeine whenever possible. If you're a heavy caffeine drinker (more than 200 milligrams per day, or about 2 cups of coffee) and you suddenly take it out of your diet, headaches are a common side-effect. Slowly overcome caffeine withdrawal if you consume too much and think this might be contributing to your headaches. Warning: Limit caffeine treatment of headaches to no more than twice a week. If you use caffeine to treat headaches more often than this, your body can become dependent on caffeine, especially among migraine sufferers.",

Drink a tall glass of water as soon as your head starts to hurt, and try to continue drinking small sips throughout the day. You may gradually feel the pain start to ease. For men, drink at least 13 cups (3 liters) of water a day. For women, drink at least 9 cups (2.2 liters) of water a day. You should drink more if you exercise frequently, live in a hot or humid environment, have an illness that causes vomiting or diarrhea, or are breastfeeding. Another way to calculate your daily water needs is by weight; every day, you should try to drink between 0.5 and 1 ounce of water for every pound that you weigh. Don\u2019t drink water that\u2019s too cold if you already have a headache. Extremely cold or iced water can trigger migraines in some people, especially if they\u2019re already prone to migraine headaches. Room-temperature water is a better option.",

If you're forced to rest around other people, explain that you have a headache and ask that they please try to be quiet and leave you undisturbed. Pre-emptively asking for cooperation can help you avoid an ugly interruption later. Make sure your bed or couch is comfortable and that your head is supported in a position that doesn't increase the tension to your neck. If one side of your neck is stretched and the other is cramped, adjust your position so that your head and neck are evenly supported. Avoid bright, unnatural light, as light makes headaches worse -- even for blind people. You can also wear an eye mask to block out light. Some people can only relax in a cool room, while others prefer a large blanket or a space heater. Try to create whatever conditions work best for you when you go to sleep at night.",

To massage your temples, place your thumbs on the soft spot between your upper ear and the corner of your eye. Keeping your thumbs on your temples, use very firm pressure and move your fingers in small, circular motions from your temple to the center of your forehead.

Squeeze your fingers to apply pressure on your shoulder muscles. Move your fingers in small, deep circular movements toward the base of your skull. Interlace your fingers behind your head. Allow your head to drop forward, letting the weight of your arms gently stretch the muscles of your neck and shoulders. Variation: Instead of massaging your neck and shoulders, find 2 tennis balls or racquetballs and put them in a sock.

Apply deep, very firm pressure for 4-5 seconds while you breathe deeply. On your shoulder: Locate the point on your shoulder muscle about halfway between your neck and the edge of your shoulder. Using your opposite hand (right hand on the left shoulder, left hand on the right shoulder), pinch the shoulder muscle between your fingers and thumb. Use your index finger to apply firm downward pressure for 4-5 seconds. On your hand: Massage the soft part of your hand in between your index finger and thumb.

Usually, they aren't as painful as other headaches, but they can last for hours or even days. A tension headache tends to form as a result of muscle contraction and is commonly felt like a band behind the eyes and across the forehead. A headache may be dull or recurrent if the source is not dealt with, and can be accompanied by feeling generally unwell, especially if the sufferer also has anxiety or depression. This type of headache tends to respond well to painkillers, rest, and alleviation of the source of stress. Massage, acupuncture, yoga, and relaxation therapies are good ways of preventing tension headaches. \"Talk therapy,\" where you work on your anxiety and stress with a mental health professional, can also help prevent and reduce tension headaches.",

Migraines can be caused by reactions to food, stressors, hormonal changes, an accident, medications, or other unknown triggers. Migraines require special medical attention If you frequently experience them, see a doctor. Regular exercise, especially aerobic exercise, can help you prevent migraine headaches by reducing tension in your body. Obesity may also be a migraine trigger, so exercise can also help prevent migraines by helping you stay at or reach a healthy weight. Warm up gradually before you exercise! Intense or sudden physical exertion without a gradual warm-up period can trigger migraines. Even brisk sexual activity can trigger a migraine in the very sensitive. Migraine headaches can also benefit from increased water consumption and a balanced diet.",

Researchers don't know exactly what causes cluster headaches, so you can't prevent the first onset of a cluster headache. Cluster headaches are one of the most painful headaches, with intense pain around your eye area (usually on one side of your head). They can also involve drooping eyelids, nasal discharge and watery eyes. If this type of head pain is occurring, take it seriously and see your doctor for advice and treatment. There are some drugs and treatments that can alleviate the symptoms. Avoiding alcohol and nicotine can help reduce your risk of future cluster headaches, although it may not have any effect on your pain while a cluster headache is occurring. Oxygen therapy, where you breath in oxygen through a mask, has proven especially helpful for cluster headaches. Studies have shown that taking 10 milligrams of melatonin before bed may reduce the frequency of cluster headache onset. This may be because cluster headaches can occur when your sleep cycle is disturbed.",

MOH headaches are treatable. In most cases, just stop using the medication and your headaches should stop within a few days. The symptoms of an MOH headache are often similar to those of tension headaches. Avoid using headache painkillers, even over-the-counter types, for more than 2 or 3 days per week. If your symptoms are severe enough to require more frequent medication, see a doctor. Use over-the-counter painkillers no more than 15 days per month. Avoid painkillers that contain opioids (codeine, morphine, hydrocodone, etc.) or butalbital (Fioricet, Ezol, Phrenilin, etc.).",

Hangover headaches are very common, and they're estimated to cost the US about $148 billion a year in lost productivity (from sufferers who call out sick or do a terrible job at work because they're hungover). Symptoms include throbbing pain, nausea, and feeling generally lousy. The only guaranteed way to prevent a hangover headache is not to drink, but staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water can help you avoid the pain of an alcohol-induced headache the next day. Other liquids, including sports drinks or even broth, can also be helpful. Avoid alcohol (obviously) and beverages that include caffeine. Alcohol and caffeine both dehydrate you. Tip: A good rule of thumb is to drink 4 times as much water as you do alcohol. Since many cocktails contain between 1-2 ounces of liquor, you should plan to drink a full, large glass of water for each alcoholic beverage you consume.",

Allergies and sensitivities can cause nasty headaches that often include a runny nose, watery eyes, and an itching or burning sensation as well as headache pain. Some allergies are seasonal, such as pollen allergies, and can be treated with antihistamines. You might also have a food allergy or sensitivity, which can trigger headaches. If you have frequent headaches with symptoms like itching or watery eyes, consider having an allergy skin test done by a medical professional. These tests expose you (safely!) to a variety of allergy triggers and can help determine whether your headaches are caused by things you're exposed to. MSG can sometimes induce headaches.  Someone with an MSG sensitivity may also experience facial pressure, chest pain, burning sensation on trunk, neck and shoulders and throbbing head. Nitrites and nitrates in meat can induce a moderate to severe headache. If you eat ice cream or drink a cold drink too quickly, you can induce a temporary \"brain freeze\" or \"ice cream headache\" which is severe but passes quickly.",

These headaches are likely to have similar symptoms to tension headaches. Making minor changes to your routine, like setting up an ergonomically correct workstation or not wearing your hair in a tight ponytail or bun, can help prevent these headaches. Eating on a regular schedule can also help prevent everyday headaches. If you don't eat regularly, your blood sugar drops, and this can trigger intense headaches and nausea.
