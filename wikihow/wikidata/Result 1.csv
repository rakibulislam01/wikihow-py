Before you build a campfire pit you need to make sure it’s allowed and if there any special steps or precautions that you’re required to take. If you’re at a campground or a park, ask the park ranger or check the rules about building a fire. There may be rules about where or how large of a fire you can build. If you’re not sure, don’t build a fire![1]', 'Check the local fire-danger level, which is usually displayed at ranger stations or along roads. If you can’t find one, try looking online or calling the local government office.', 'Warning: Sometimes the weather conditions make building a fire dangerous. High winds or a drought could increase the risk of starting a wildfire, so make sure you know if it’s permitted to start a fire before you do it.', '2', 'Select a flat spot away from trees, dry grass, and lots of leaves. Low hanging branches from trees and lots of brush or dry grass can easily catch fire and get out of control quickly. Choosing flat and level ground to build a campfire pit will also help prevent any coals or embers from rolling away. A good rule of thumb is to choose an area that is at least 5–10 feet (1.5–3.0\xa0m) away from trees and brush.[2]', '3', 'Pick a spot that protects your fire pit from the wind. Takeke because the coals are concentrated in the bowl. Use a shovel or a sturdy stick to dig out the indentation.[6]', 'The width of the bowl could vary depending on how large of a fire you’re building, but a 1 foot (0.30\xa0m) diameter bowl should be sufficient for most campfires.', '3', 'Use rocks or large logs to form a 2 feet (0.61\xa0m) diameter ring. Rocks that are fist-sized or larger are great for making a containment ring. Place them side by side without any gaps in between them to form a containment circle. You could also use large logs to make a ring around the fire pit—just make sure they’re not so dry that they’ll catch fire easily.[7]', 'A ring with a 2 feet (0.61\xa0m) diameter should be large enough for a medium-sized fire, but you can make a larger ring if needed.', 'Warning: Don’t use rocks that have been submerged in water or they can explode when they’re heated. Logs that are soaked in water are safe to use.', '4', 'Build a fire inside the containment ring. Gather some small brush or leaves for note of strong prevailing winds and choose a location that is protected from direct exposure to them. Strong winds can blow coals from the fire and spread it. Try to avoid building a campfire pit in an open area exposed to high winds.[3]', 'Use natural features like hills or boulders to shield your fire pit from the wind.', 'Arrange your camp so that the wind is at your back to block or deflect it from blowing directly onto your fire.', 'If the wind is strong enough to blow debris around, it’s too windy to start a fire!', '4', 'Choose a place at least 15 feet (4.6\xa0m) away from your lodging. It may be tempting to build a nice fire near the entrance of your cabin or tent to help keep warm, but the materials that make up your tent, cabin, or another form of lodging may not need to be exposed to a direct flame to heat up and catch fire. Be sure to choose a place for your fire pit that’s far enough away from your lodging and camping supplies.[4]', 'Don’t place a sleeping bag next to a campfire because the material could catch fire before you notice it!'], ['Part 2', 'Building a Containment Ring', '1', 'Clear an area at least 10 feet (3.0\xa0m) around the pit. Before you start to build the containment ring for your fire, you should remove any fire hazards that could cause the fire to spread. Pick up any sticks, leaves, or other flammable material around the area of your fire pit.[5]', 'Even if the leaves or branches are damp, you still need to clear them from the area because they could dry out and catch fire.', 'Try to rake up any dry leaves as well.', '2', 'Dig out a bowl-shaped indentation about 5 inches (13\xa0cm) deep. A small indentation in the ground will help contain the coals and protect them from the wind. It also allows your fire to burn bright and hot with less smo tinder, some dry, medium-sized branches for kindling, and larger dry logs to use as fuel for your fire. Make a teepee structure with your tinder and kindling and light the tinder at the center of the teepee. Add the larger logs when the fire gets going.[8]', 'You’ll need about 4-5 logs to keep a campfire burning for 2 hours, so make sure you gather enough.', 'Keep the logs you plan to use as fuel at least 10 feet (3.0\xa0m) away from the fire pit so there’s no chance they could catch fire.', 'Make sure you gather enough fuel to last for as long as you need a fire.', 'Bring your own firewood if there isn’t any available around you or if you’re not permitted to collect it. Contact a park ranger or a local government office to make sure you can gather and burn wood around you.', '5', 'Keep a bucket that holds 2 gallons (7.6\xa0L) of water nearby. It’s always a good idea to keep a bucket or large container of water near the area of the fire pit in case you need to put out any sparks or embers that pop out of the fire. A fire can get out of control quickly, so keep enough water to put the whole fire out at a moment’s notice.[9]', 'Always put out your fire when you are ready to leave. Soak the pit with water before you leave, even if you let the fire die out on its own.', 'Keep a fire extinguisher on hand as well to prevent a possible forest fire.', 'Having water nearby also makes the job of extinguishing the fire quick and easy.']]'|'3.052992'|'2019-07-11 06:56:07.0

But other types of gentle exercise may be beneficial, such as doing ankle pumps while lying down.', '2', 'Do arm exercises if you have had a mastectomy or lymph node surgery. While lying or sitting, raise your arm above the level of your heart and hold it there. Then, open and close your hand 15 to 25 times while continuing to hold your arm up.

Be cautious when cutting vegetables or meat in the kitchen, and don’t stand too close to your stove while cooking to avoid oil splatter.[11]', 'Make sure to wash your hands regularly as well. It is especially important to wash your hands before and after caring for your surgical site since dirty hands can introduce bacteria that may lead to an infection and cause swelling.', '2', 'Put on sunscreen and bug repellent when you go outside.

Use an electric razor instead of a razor blade and do not use a hair-removal cream.[14]', 'Tip: It’s also a good idea to wear a thimble if you have to use a needle and thread, such as to mend a pair of pants.', '4', 'Wear loose fitting clothing that allows your skin to breathe. This will help to prevent swelling by allowing your blood to circulate freely under your skin. Opt for loose fitting pants, skirts, tops, and undergarments while you are recovering from surgery.[15]', 'The only exception to this would be if you have been instructed to wear a compression garment by your doctor. In this case, a constricting medical piece of clothing will help to reduce swelling rather than promote it.', '5', 'Don’t smoke or drink alcohol. Not only will smoking and drinking impede your healing after surgery, they will also affect your circulation and this may contribute to swelling.

This can help you walk longer, and at a better pace. Try to warm up by walking slowly for five to 10 minutes at the beginning of the walk.', 'This will loosen up your muscles and get them ready for exercise. To warm up do the following for 30 seconds each: Make circles with each ankle: swing each leg: make slow circles with your hips or legs: make arm circles: March in place: and swing your legs back and forth.', 'Similarly, cool down at the end of your walk by slowing down for 5 to 10 minutes. After you cool down, stretch your muscles gently.', 'Warming up properly can help you avoid walking injuries, such as strained muscles.', '2', 'Improve your walking posture.

Tighten your stomach muscles, and don’t arch your back forward or backward.', '3', 'Walk heel to toe. When walking, you should step forward with your foot. Let your heel land on the ground in front of you. Then, roll your foot forward, transferring your weight to the ball of your foot. With your other foot, raise your heel, push your foot off the ground with your big toe, and repeat the first process.[2]', 'Walking is different from running. Your feet should never lift off the ground completely at the same time.', "Find a stride that's comfortable for you. If you're losing track of the heel-to-toe motion, and aren't rolling your feet consistently, you may need to slow down.", '4', 'Straighten out your legs if you have tight hips or hamstrings. If you sit too much, you may have a tendency to always bend your knees while walking. This usually means that your hip flexors and hamstrings are too tight. As you walk, make a conscious effort to straighten out your legs.', '5', 'Avoid hyperextending your knee. Hyperextending your knee means moving your knee backwards slightly when standing or walking.

Motivate yourself by remembering that you can burn about 400 calories from a brisk walk, although it takes about 5 miles to do so.', 'If you want to lose weight, it’s a good idea to also reduce how many calories you eat per day and to eat healthier unprocessed foods. Try to add 2,000 steps into your daily routine when you first start walking. Sometimes you can add steps just by making small lifestyle choices every single day, such as taking the stairs at work when you could take the elevator.', 'If you don’t see weight loss right away, it might be because you are starting to build up muscle, which is good. Be patient, and you will see results over the course of time. Slowly add more steps each week.', '2', 'Aim to walk for 21 minutes per day. If you prefer to have a few days off during any given week, that’s fine too. Just aim to walk a total of around 2.5 hours per week.', 'One benefit of walking is that you don’t need a lot of specialized equipment to do it. You can walk wherever you are, even if you are on vacation.

The Center for Disease Control suggests that at least 7,000 to 8,000 steps is a good threshold for a healthy adult.', 'It’s possible to walk about 1,000 steps in 10 minutes. Ten thousand steps is about 5 miles a day.[6]', 'Record your steps every day and figure out your daily and weekly average. The goal is for the average to go up gradually as your endurance increases and you walk more.', '2', 'Buy decent shoes for walking. Walking is a very inexpensive form of exercise, but you do need to invest in a decent pair of shoes. Shoes specifically designed for walking are sold, but running and cross training shoes can also work.', 'Comfortable shoes that provide adequate support while walking are very important. Don’t wear shoes that cause blisters.[7] The shoes should have good arch support and thick flexible soles to absorb shock.', 'Shoes that work for walking should bend through the ball of the feet pretty easily while still being fairly durable.

Walk on sidewalks or on the left side of the street facing traffic if a sidewalk is not available.', 'Carry your ID, a cell phone, and some change so that you can use a pay phone if you need to do so. Wear reflective gear if you are walking at dusk or night (which can be very dangerous).', 'Take care when you wear headphones because they will screen out noise that can alert you of dangers. Consider wearing only one head piece in so you can still hear traffic.', '5', 'Switch the locale. Although walking can be a very relaxing and enjoyable activity, it can also bore you if you do it alone and along the same exact route every day.', 'Instead, mix up where you walk. Walk around a park, down a riverside path, through woodlands, and down a subdivision road.', 'Choose a course that isn’t filled with cracked sidewalks, potholes or low-hanging tree limbs that could cause injury. Listen to music on an MP3 player as you walk to reduce boredom.', 'Walk with other people, such as a family member, neighbor or other friend, so as to improve motivation.

However, Bradamante initially posed as a male until meeting and falling in love with Rogero (Ruggiero).[6][7]', '3', 'Learn from your parents what it means to be a knight. For the first seven years of his life, a boy would learn the manners required of a knight from his parents, who told him stories of chivalrous deeds and took him to tournaments. Play time involved taking up a wooden sword and shield against imagined enemies of the liege lord.', '4', 'Become a page. At age 7, a boy would become a page (also called a varlet, meaning “little vassal”) in the service of a noble and any ladies of the court who resided under the noble’s roof. He would be dressed in the lord’s colors and placed under the older pages in the lord’s service. As a page, his service would be divided among household duties, physical activities, and education.', 'Household duties included serving as waiter and busboy at the lord’s table, maintaining the lord’s clothes and helping him dress. This included helping the lord into and out of his armor at jousting tournaments.', 'Physical activities included learning to ride and hunt, both with arms and with a hawk or falcon. The swordplay he practiced under his parents’ roof would become more formalized, and the page would also learn how to joust by holding a lance while riding a wheeled hobby horse pulled by two other pages toward a target.', 'Education built on the manners training the page received from his parents, and also included religious training and developing thinking skills through games such as chess and backgammon.', 'The more wealthy the noble, the greater the prestige associated with serving as a page to him. However, the more wealthy the noble, the more pages he had and the greater the competition among the pages for status within the noble’s house. [8]', '5', 'Become a squire. Usually at age 14, but sometimes as young as age 10,[9], a page would be apprenticed to a specific knight as his armiger or squire, from the French “escuyer” for “shield bearer.” In this role, the knight-in-training was regarded as a young man and so had greater duties, responsibilities, and expectations than when he was a page.', 'The household duties of waiting at table on the lord of the manor were now transferred to assisting his knight in similar fashion. The squire also helped his knight into his armor and maintained it, assisting him both at tournaments and in battle, and saw to the care of the knight’s horse. A squire who assisted the lord of the manor in this fashion was known as the “squire of the body” and was considered the highest ranking of all the squires of the manor.[10]', 'Swordplay with wooden swords and lance-play on a hobby horse were now replaced with real weapons. Squires also had to learn to swim and climb to be able to storm a castle.', 'Manners lessons included learning the code of chivalry (conduct in battle and regard for those the knight served to protect)[11] as well as music and dancing. Squires also learned the art of heraldry, the symbols for their own and other noble houses so they could tell friend from foe on the field.', '6', 'Be invested as a knight. Assuming the squire showed himself worthy of his lessons, at age 21, he would be dubbed a knight. (In some cases, such as particular valor in combat, he might receive the honor sooner, much as battlefield promotions are accorded today, and with only a brief ritual dubbing.)[12] The formal knighting ceremony was highly ritualized and involved the following steps:', 'A night vigil in the chapel of the castle whose lord the knight-to-be would represent, including a ritual bath to symbolically purify the candidate. The candidate was clad in a white vestment to represent purity, covered with a red robe to represent nobility. On his feet and legs were black shoes and stockings to represent that he would give his life in the service of his lord and chivalry if need be. The sword and shield the knight would wield would be placed on the chapel altar, while the candidate knelt or stood before it in silent prayer for a period of 10 hours.', 'In the morning, a Mass was held with a sermon on the duties of the knight. At this point, the knight-to-be’s friends and family were in attendance. The priest then blessed the sword and shield and handed them to the knight’s sponsor, who then passed them to the lord who would conduct the ceremony. This might be the lord of the manor, a greater noble, or even the king. .[13] (By the time of Henry VIII, only the reigning monarch conferred knighthood.)[14]', 'Two sponsors presented the knight to the presiding lord, in whose presence the knight swore an oath of allegiance and vows to shun traitors, to treat women with the greatest respect, and to observe all the rituals of the Church. The presiding lord then presented the knight with the sword and shield and touched him on the shoulder with either the flat of the sword or the flat of his hand, saying, “I dub thee Sir <the knight’s name>.” The sponsors then put the sword and its scabbard around the knight’s waist and spurs on his heels, at which time the knight could use the title “Sir” himself.[15]', 'Becoming a knight required being able to afford the expenses associated with the honor. Those squires who could not afford it were called “arma patrina” and were allowed to carry a lance and shield, but did not have any of the other accoutrement of knighthood.[16]', 'The "Squire of the Body" often accompanied the knight onto the field of battle, where he would, at a distance, hold and maintain the knights spare accoutrement. If the knight fell in battle, the Squire of the Body would take up a weapon and protect his knight\'s body. Should the squire prevail over an assailing knight, he had the right to take the horse, shield, armor and sword from the knight he defeated. That would then become his armorial, and he would automatically assume the knighthood of his vanquished.'], ['Method 2', 'Becoming a Knight of the British Empire', '1', 'Be outstanding in your field.

In a compound time signature, dotted notes get the beat, such as a dotted quarter note, dotted half note, and so on. The main way to identify a compound meter is to look at the upper number. For a compound meter, it must be 6 or higher and a multiple of 3. [1]', 'Following the rule of compound meters, 6/4 is a compound meter because there\'s a "6" on top, which is multiple of 3. 3/8, however, is a simple meter because the top number is less than 6.', 'Time signatures are also referred to as meter signatures, and the time signatures tell you the meter for the song.', 'When looking at the top number, it tells you the type of meter of the song: 2 = simple double, 3 = simple triple, 4 = simple quadruple, 6 = compound double, 8 = compound triple, and 12 = compound quadruple.', '2', 'Identify what note gets the beat in a simple time signature by looking at the bottom number.

The "4" on the bottom tells you the quarter note gets the beat.', '3', "Figure out which dotted note gets the beat in compound time signatures. In compound meters, it's a little more complicated, as you could describe it 2 ways. A dotted note always gets the beat, but you can also look at it as a division of a dotted note, divided into 3 shorter notes of equal length.[4]", 'For instance, each of these bottom numbers tells you the following in a compound meter:', 'A "4" means the dotted half note gets the beat, which can be divided into 3 quarter notes.', '"8" tells you the dotted quarter note gets the beat, which is equal to 3 eighth notes.', 'A "16" shows you the dotted eighth note has the beat, equal to 3 sixteenth notes.', '6/8 time is a compound time signature.

Eighth notes are half a beat, and they have a filled in circle with a little flag at the top right of the stem, though sometimes they are connected to each other at the top.[7]", 'Rests also get beats, the same as their note equivalents.

If more are eighth notes, it may make sense to have the eighth note take the beat. Basically, you want to make it as easy as possible when you're counting the beat, and therefore, the notes the appear the most should take the beat.[10]", 'For example, if the notes are 2 quarter notes, a half note, and a half rest, the time signature could be 6/4 or 12/8.

You shouldn't use decimals, so 2.5/2 is out. 10/8 doesn't make a lot of sense because you don't have any eighth notes, so 5/4 is the most likely, where you're counting quarter notes as 1 beat.[11]", '3', "Aim for the longest note value possible when counting the beats. Typically, when deciding on a time signature, try to count the longest note value as the base beat, meaning which note gets the beat.

When the bottom number of the signature is 4, the eighth notes are often grouped by 2s, connected at the top with their flags.

Even though the drums will often hit the even beats, other instruments in the song may hit the backbeats or the odd beats. So while you may hear a more solid thudding on the even beats, listen for the other beats to have emphasis elsewhere.[18]', '4', 'Check for major changes on the first beat of the measure. For instance, you may hear chord changes on the first beat of most measures. Alternatively, you may hear other changes, like melody movement or harmony changes. Often, the first note of the measure is where major changes in the song happen.[19]', "It can help to listen for strong and weak notes. For instance, the beats for duple time (2/4 and 6/8), are strong-weak. The beats for triple time (3/4 and 9/8), are strong-weak-weak, while for quadruple time (4/4 or 'C' for common time and 12/8), they're strong-weak-medium-weak.", '5', 'Try to hear how the beats are grouped based on the cues. For instance, you may notice beats are grouped in 2s, 3s, or 4s. Count the beats out if you can. Listen for the first beat in each measure, then count out the notes, 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3, etc., until you hear the first beat of the next measure.[20]', '6', 'Choose the most likely time signature for the song. If you are hearing 4 strong beats in a measure, you likely have a 4/4 time signature as that\'s the most common in pop, rock, and other popular music. Remember, the bottom "4" tells you the quarter note gets the beat, and the top "4" tells you that you have 4 beats in each measure. If you feel 2 strong beats but also hear notes in triples behind it, you might have a 6/8 time, which is counted in 2s but each one of those beats can be divided into 3 eighth notes.[21]', '2/4 time is most often used in polkas and marches. You may hear "om-pa-pa, om-pa-pa" in this type of song, where the "om" is a quarter note on the first beat and the "pa-pa" is 2 eighth notes on the second beat.', "Another possibility is 3/4, which is often used in waltzes and minuets.

Whether you have volatile screaming matches or you sit down together to compromise before things get too heated, almost every style of conflict allows for some form of reconciliation. No matter how you and your partner fight, make sure you both, in the end, feel heard and are able to come to some kind of agreement.[15]", '4', 'Balance your negative and positive feelings toward each other. Balance is important in creating a happy and loving relationship. Research shows that with stability over time, the magic ratio for positive and negative interactions in relationships is five to one, or five positive interactions for every one negative interaction.
